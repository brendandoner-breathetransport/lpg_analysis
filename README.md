Within the repo you will find models and notebooks that analyze the relationship between:

1. Propane pricing and demand (private data: Oil Price Information Service LLC)
2. Propane demand and air pollution (public data: PM2.5 measurements from various satellite missions https://sites.wustl.edu/acag/datasets/surface-pm2-5/)
3. Propane demand and deforestation (public data: Normalized Density Vegetation Index, i.e. NDVI, from the MODIS satellite mission https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/)
